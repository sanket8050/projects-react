🚀 I Built a React Application with Razorpay Payment Gateway Integration
Want to add seamless payments to your web app? I developed a React application integrated with Razorpay and MongoDB, creating a secure and efficient payment solution for e-commerce use cases. Here’s a look at the project and my key takeaways.

❓ Why I Built This:
Modern web apps require robust payment systems and reliable data storage. My goals were to:
🛒 Deliver a smooth checkout experience
🔒 Ensure secure transaction processing
📊 Store and display dynamic order details post-payment

💡 What My Project Does:

Streamlined Checkout Process: Utilizes Razorpay’s pre-built checkout UI for a fast, intuitive payment flow.



Secure Backend Verification: Implements server-side validation to authenticate transactions and prevent fraud.



Dynamic Success Page: Renders a responsive page with product details and transaction confirmation, fetched from MongoDB.

🛠 Tech Stack:





Frontend: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS



Backend: Node.js, Express (for API handling)



Payment Gateway: Razorpay API



Database: MongoDB (local instance for storing transaction and product data)



Tools: Axios (for API calls), React Router (for navigation), Mongoose (for MongoDB integration)

🧪 How You Can Use It (Step-by-Step):
🧩 1. Clone the Repository





Visit my GitHub repo



url = https://github.com/sanket8050/projects-react/tree/main/razorpay-mern%20p2



Run git clone <url> in your terminal
🛠 2. Set Up MongoDB Locally



Install MongoDB on your machine if not already installed



Start the MongoDB server: mongod (ensure it’s running on mongodb://localhost:27017)



The app uses a local MongoDB instance to store transaction and product data
🛠 3. Install Dependencies



Navigate to the project folder: cd project-folder



For the backend, run npm install in the backend folder



For the frontend, run npm install in the frontend folder
🚀 4. Set Up Environment Variables



Create a .env file in the backend folder



Add your Razorpay API keys (e.g., RAZORPAY_KEY_ID, RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET) and MongoDB connection string (e.g., MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database)



Refer to the .env.example file in the repo for guidance
✅ 5. Start the Backend Server



In the backend folder, run npm run dev



The server will start on http://localhost:4000 (or your configured port)
🧱 6. Run the React Frontend



In the frontend folder, run npm run dev



The app will launch on http://localhost:5173 (or your configured port)



Open the app in your browser and test the payment flow

🧩 Challenges I Faced:
⚠️ Configuring Razorpay webhooks for real-time transaction updates
📡 Securing API communication between React, backend, and MongoDB
🧱 Managing MongoDB schema design and environment variables for sensitive keys

📚 What I Learned:





Integrating Razorpay payment APIs with React and Node.js



Managing asynchronous payment flows and MongoDB transactions



Implementing secure server-side transaction verification



Designing MongoDB schemas for efficient data storage and retrieval



Building responsive UI components for payment confirmation
